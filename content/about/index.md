## Who am I?

Just a guy with a keen interest in all things computation, a PhD in [Complex Systems and Data Science](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/education/phd/), a bunch of deep learning experience in continual and meta-learning, and a passion for cellular automata.

## What is this blog?
A quiet place for some thoughts?  

There are no cookies, no ads, no SEO, no comments, no subscriptions, no algorithmic feed.  Mostly just words, images and [p5](https://p5js.org/). Made by a human for other humans and some friendly machines.

## What is this About?
It's a meta-section of the blog where I talk about the blog.

## What is this about?
This blog is about... well pretty much anything that persists in my thoughts long enough to require a written ejection. Mostly computation, computers and computronium. I guess I'll update this list as I add more content to the blog.
